Damascus Denim Desk

The worlds first “Damascus Denim” table. This is a Timbercraft original creation, over 1000 sq ft (100 square meters) of denim fabric infused with epoxy, and layered in such a way that a damascus pattern has been exposed on the top. The patterns you see are not painted or printed on, you are seeing the actual layers of denim. And despite what is looks like, the top is as smooth as glass and many times stronger than wood. While maintaining a warm, wood like feel.

The base is a minimalist White Oak frame that is very sturdy, but does not distract from the top.

The top measures approximately 30x60” and is 30.5” tall.
