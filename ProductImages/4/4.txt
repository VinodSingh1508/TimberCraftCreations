Continental Shift Round Epoxy Table

The Continental Shift Round Epoxy Table was created from a rare cross section of a black walnut root ball. What resulted is an incredible variation of color, figure, and shape. The gaps were then filled with a black tinted epoxy resin, which highlighted the natural blacks in the walnut and allowed for the perfect circle shape to be cut. 

The legs on this table were designed by the client, then 3D rendered by my metal fabricator before construction. We can do most any leg design you can come up with. Just let us know what youâ€™d like!
