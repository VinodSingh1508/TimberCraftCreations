Spalted Maple Sculpted 'Snake' End Table

This sculpted end table is part of a series blending art with functionality. The base is hand sculpted from locally salvaged maple, then fitted to a striking spalted maple top. While it may look delicate, it is extremely sturdy and has no wobble at all. Please note that spalted maple similar to this is extremely rare and will likely not be possible for a custom order. Please donâ€™t hesitate to email to discuss further though.
