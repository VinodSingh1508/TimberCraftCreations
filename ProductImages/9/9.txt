Timbercrafts Signature Resin Table

Locally salvaged Oregon Black Walnut and jet-black epoxy resin. This is the style of table that Timbercraft Creations is most know for. This is far from the traditional "river table" with two pieces of wood set indiscriminately next to each other. The Timbercraft Creations series sources one oversized slab with natural voids and cracks that can highlight the grain and color of the walnut without overpowering the beauty of the natural wood.

This particular table was fitted with a custom "spider" base that was sized specifically for this table and fabricated locally.
