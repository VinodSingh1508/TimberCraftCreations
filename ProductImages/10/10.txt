Brass Creek Resin Table

This piece was carefully crafted from a series of walnut burl pieces and joined together with a striking black resin. It is always our opinion that you cannot improve on nature, that is why all of our pieces are designed to look like they fit together as if nature created them. We take this one step further and finish our pieces with an all natural finish that doesn't cover the grain, but highlights it. The top was then fitted to a brass colored base that was custom fabricated for this table specifically.
