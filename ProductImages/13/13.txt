Solid Denim Desk


Every aspect of this table was hand made. From the layering of denim, to the hand stitched leather that was used to wrap the solid oak legs.

This desk was made from over 1000 square feet of 14oz denim infused with epoxy resin. Then sanded and polished to a high gloss. The result is a remarkably original, but somehow familiar design. Despite the look, the table is flat and smooth as glass. It was finished with a commercial grade clearcoat, which makes it as durable (likely more durable) as any piece of wood furniture.

The legs are made from solid White Oak wrapped in real hand stitched automotive leather.
