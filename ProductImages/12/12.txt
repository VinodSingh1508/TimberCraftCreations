Reverse Resin Desk

This reverse resin desk was made with a very rare bookmatched piece of English Walnut and jet black epoxy resin. Unlike a traditional epoxy table, this desk has the resin on the outside of the wood. Instead of the between the slabs. The legs were custom fabricated out of solid steel and are a unique minimalist style that compliments the modern profile of the desk edge.

The table was made by pouring one inch of epoxy, then flipping the edge to double the profile. This reduces the waste, and keeps the table lighter at the same time. The legs are attached via threaded inserts, so assembly and disassembly can be done an infinite number of times.

This desk measures 56x29" and 30" tall. Please reach out to discuss shipping options and cost before adding to your cart.
