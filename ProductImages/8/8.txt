Copper Creek Resin Table

The Copper Creek epoxy resin table was created from a single slab of locally sourced Oregon black walnut. Each piece was cut and meticulously arranged along side the client who commissioned the table. 

The base was custom made by a local fabricator to the clients specifications. Then painted with a special blend to mimic the look of real copper. Without the risk of tarnishing over time like real copper will.
