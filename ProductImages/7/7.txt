Fire & Waterfall Desk


A single slab of salvaged Oregon White Oak with a twist. Or at least a turn. This desk features a classic "waterfall edge" where the grain turns 90 degrees and continues seemingly unbroken. What makes this slab so unique is the combination of charred sections that also follow the waterfall pattern. Each charred section was filled with resin and then polished to a mirror shine. While leaving the wood essentially matte.

This piece measures approximately 65x30" and is 30" tall
