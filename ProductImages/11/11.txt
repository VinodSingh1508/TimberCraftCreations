Timbercraft Creations Live Edge Mirror

The Timbercraft Creations Live Edge Mirror is a piece of functional art that can compliment your furniture, or stand out on its own. Each mirror is custom made from hand picked locally salvaged wood. So you can be sure you have the only one like it.

Some mirrors feature a "bookmatch" set. Where the two sides form a mirror image of each other. While others are arranged from individual slabs. We do try and keep some inventory on hand, but if you have a particular style in mind feel free to shoot us a message to ensure we get you exactly what youâ€™re looking for.

Due to the natural variance of the slabs, these mirrors vary slightly in size, but are approximately 48x18" and 3/4" thick. They come with heavy duty picture wire attached and are ready to hang immediately.
