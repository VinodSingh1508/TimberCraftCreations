The Bistro Bookmatch

One of a kind is a wild understatement when it comes to this particular piece. The top was salvaged from a burn pile, and after roughly 20 hours of painstaking labor, what you see now was created.  A mirror image or “bookmatched” top with striking grain, figure, symmetry, and pitch-black epoxy filling and stabilizing every crack and void. 

The base was then hand-sculpted from solid black walnut to naturally taper similar to a traditional ax handle in the center. then flares out to a perfectly round base. 

Top is 22” in diameter and the entire piece is 42” tall.
