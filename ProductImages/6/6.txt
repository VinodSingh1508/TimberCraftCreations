Luthier Slab Desk

This desk was cut from a single slab of locally salvaged Mappa Burl. Unlike most live-edge tables, this desk features the live edge on the short sides. Meaning this tree was massive enough to merit cutting the slab unconventionally. The result is a nice straight edge to work against and/or to place against a wall. That doesnâ€™t mean this desk is small, though. It is approximately 55" wide and 30" front to back.

The remarkable color comes from a combination of the natural chatoyancy of the wood and a deep black dye that fades from the edges to the center. This color/application method was inspired by the famous PRS guitars, hence the "Luthier Slab Desk" name.

The base on this desk is an adjustable height sit-stand base. It ranges from 22" to 46", with programmable one-touch favorite heights. The base is satin black and extremely sturdy. It complements the top but does not distract from it. This desk will even ship entirely assembled. So all you need to do is remove it from the crate and choose your height.

Please note that shipping is not included and has to be paid by the customer during delivery.
